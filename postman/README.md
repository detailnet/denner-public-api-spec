#### Collection data

Choose the one that best fits the testing situation you need:

- GitHub repository | e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/detailnet/denner-portal-api-spec/master/postman/collections/denner-api.json
- Local checkout through Protobox | e.g. http://denner-portal-api-spec.web01.detailnet.me/postman/collections/denner-api.json

> You can also access different branches on GitHub (replace `master` with the branch name).

#### Import environments

  - Move the mouse pointer over the eye dropdown menu (top bar).
  - Click on "Manage environments"
- Click on "Import" button, choose all files in the project environments directory (all at once).

> There is no direct possibility to import from an URL, but you can use your OS as wrapper. 
> To do so enter an URL instead of a file in the file selection window (e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/detailnet/denner-portal-api-spec/master/postman/environments/denner-api_web01.json).

#### Setup global variables

We use global variables to store data that is your own, and must not be shared with others.

Currently we support following global variables:

- `denner_advertising_app_id`
- `denner_advertising_app_key`
- `denner_appraisals_app_key` (doesn't require an "id")
- `denner_articles_app_id`
- `denner_articles_app_key`
- `denner_assets_app_id`
- `denner_assets_app_key`
- `denner_banners_app_key` (doesn't require an "id")
- `denner_stores_app_id`
- `denner_stores_app_key`

Set up global variables:

- Go to the environments manager window.
  - Move the mouse pointer over the eye drop-down menu (top bar).
  - Click on "Manage environments".
- Click on "Globals" button.
- Add the variables.
